    """
    Abstract base class representing an agent for reinforcement learning.

    This class serves as a foundational structure for any specific agent implementation in a reinforcement learning
    environment. It defines the basic interface that all derived agents must adhere to, specifically the 
    `generate_action` method. The `generate_action` method is intended to encapsulate the agent's decision-making 
    process, where given a state, the agent determines the next action to take.

    Methods:
    - generate_action(state): Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses. It defines how the agent 
      generates an action based on the given state.
